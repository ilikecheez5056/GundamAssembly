# GundamAssembly
This is adds gundam themed MIPS instructions to MARS assembly. It includes 10 renamed basic MIPS instructions such as add, addi, sub, jump, mul, xor, or, slt, beq, and bne.
It also includes 10 non basic MIPS instructions that are inspired by gundam. The instructions include terminology that I think would be commonly used when piloting a gundam
such as scatter, beamfuse, fullburst, etc.
